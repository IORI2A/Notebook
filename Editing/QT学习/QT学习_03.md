# The QML Reference 

## QML Syntax Basics 

- 通过属性来定义对象。
objects to be defined in terms of their attributes and how they relate and respond to changes in other objects.

### Import Statements

- 多种 Import 语句
A QML document may have one or more imports at the top of the file. An import can be any one of:
a versioned namespace into which types have been registered (e.g., by a plugin)
a relative directory which contains type-definitions as QML documents
a JavaScript file

- JavaScript 文件名须引号引住。
JavaScript file imports must be qualified when imported, so that the properties and methods they provide can be accessed.

### Object Declarations

- 结构上来看，是定义出 QML 对象树。
a block of QML code defines a tree of QML objects to be created. 

- object declarations 。对象声明方式来创建对象、设定属性。
Objects are defined using object declarations that describe the type of object to be created as well as the attributes that are to be given to the object.

- nested object declarations 。对象内部可声明子对象（内嵌）。
Each object may also declare child objects using nested object declarations.

- 对象声明语法。
An object declaration consists of the name of its object type, followed by a set of curly braces. 

- 属性同行，使用分号分隔。
If an object definition only has a small number of properties, it can be written on a single line like this, with the properties separated by semi-colons:

#### Child Objects

- 对象内部可声明子对象。
Any object declaration can define child objects through nested object declarations. In this way, any object declaration implicitly declares an object tree that may contain any number of child objects.

- QML 对象树(object tree)中的父子关系，与可视化界面(visual scene)上的父子关系不一定完全一致。
parent-child relationship in the context of the QML object tree, not in the context of the visual scene. 

- 在可视化界面(visual scene)元素(Item)间才谈及可视化界面父子关系的概念。(visual parent)
The concept of a parent-child relationship in a visual scene is provided by the Item type from the QtQuick module, which is the base type for most QML types, as most QML objects are intended to be visually rendered.

- 元素存在预定默认属性名。默认属性名一般不用直接写出来。
the children property of Item has been set as the type's default property to enable this more convenient syntax.

### Comments

- 单行、多行注释。
The syntax for commenting in QML is similar to that of JavaScript:
Single line comments start with // and finish at the end of the line.
Multiline comments start with /* and finish with */

# Concepts - Visual Parent in Qt Quick 

## Visual Parent

- visual scenes? visual parent?
When creating visual scenes with Qt Quick, it is important to understand the concept of the visual parent.

- 可视化父无素(visual parent)，对象父元素(object parent)，两者是有区别但又相关的。
The concept of the visual parent in Qt Quick is separate from, but related to, the concept of the object parent within the QObject parent hierarchy. 

- 所有 QML 对象都有 object parent ，就是它声明时的外围元素对象。
All QML objects have an object parent, which is determined by the object hierarchy in which the object is declared. 

- QtQuick 模块中的 Item 类型体系引入了 visual parent 概念。并由元素的 parent 属性绑定。
When working with the QtQuick module, the Item type is the base type for all visual items provided by this module, and it provides the concept of an additional visual parent, as defined by an item's parent property.

- 每个 Item 体系的对象都应当有一个 visual parent ，如果没有(null)，那它将不会显示到界面上。
Every item has a visual parent; if an item's parent property value is null, the item will not be rendered in the scene.

- 元素的 data 属性（类似数组），就是包含子对象的。默认不用写出来，声明子对象时自动绑定。
Any object assigned to an item's data property becomes a child of the item 

- 如果包含到 data 属性中的元素是 Item 体系类型，那么该元素也自动绑定到父元素的 children 属性中，并成为父元素在可视化界面(visual scene)中的一个子对象。
Additionally, if an object added to the data property is of the Item type, it is also assigned to the Item::children property and becomes a child of the item within the visual scene hierarchy. 

- data 属性就默认属性。如果一个子元素没有绑定具体的属性，那么就会归到 data 属性中。
For convenience, the Item data property is its default property. 
This means that any child item declared within an Item object without being assigned to a specific property is automatically assigned to the data property and becomes a child of the item as described above.

- 元素的 visual parent 是可以在任何时间通过变更 parent 属性绑定来更改的，但 object parent 声明时就确定了无法变更。因此两者的指代是有可能不一样。
An item's visual parent can be changed at any time by setting its parent property. Thus, an item's visual parent may not necessarily be the same as its object parent.

- 声明一个子元素，并不意味着子元素会显示到父元素中。(visual parent 的设定相关)
Declaring an item as a child of another does not automatically mean that the child item will be appropriately positioned or sized to fit within its parent. 

- QML 中有些类型内置实现强制如何布局定位子元素。
Some QML types may have in-built behaviors that affect the positioning of child items

- 是否显示在父元素范围内？
Additionally, a parent item will not automatically clip its children to visually contain them within the parent's visual bounds, unless its clip property is set to true.

## Item Coordinates

- 元素的坐标体系是参考其 visual parent 元素的。
As item coordinates are relative to the visual parent, they can be affected by changes to the visual hierarchy. 

## Stacking Order

- 通常情况，子元素绘制于父元素上，同级元素按创建顺序绘制。（后来居上）
In general items are drawn on top of their parent items, in the order they were created (or specified in the QML file).

- z 坐标属性。可重新定义显示层级。
Stacking order can be influenced with the Item::z property. 
Z values below 0 will stack below the parent, and if z values are assigned then siblings will stack in z-order (with creation order used to break ties). 

- z 值仅影响与父元素、兄弟元素之间的显示层级。（如父元素的兄弟元素（叔、伯）显示层级不受影响。）
Z values only affect stacking compared to siblings and the parent item.
